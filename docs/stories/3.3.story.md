Extensions needed:

- UserService requires user management methods (CRUD, role assignment, status management)
- AssetService requires asset management methods (CRUD, owner/administrator assignment)
- New management endpoints in UserController and AssetController
- Repository pattern extensions for complex Prisma queries with search and filtering

### Frontend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

Next.js Web application should follow:

- **组件**: 采用分层结构(ui, layout, features, forms)和标准化的编码模板 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **状态管理**: 使用 Zustand，并按业务领域划分 Store [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **路由**: 使用 Next.js App Router，并通过在布局中检查认证状态来保护路由 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **服务层**: 创建统一的 API 客户端，将 API 调用逻辑与 UI 组件分离 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

### API Specifications [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]

- REST API style using OpenAPI 3.0 standards [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]
- User and Asset management endpoints should follow REST conventions:
  - GET /api/users - List users with pagination and filtering
  - POST /api/users - Create new user
  - PUT /api/users/:id - Update user
  - DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete user
  - PATCH /api/users/:id/role - Update user role
  - PATCH /api/users/:id/status - Activate/deactivate user
  - GET /api/assets - List assets with pagination and filtering
  - POST /api/assets - Create new asset
  - PUT /api/assets/:id - Update asset
  - DELETE /api/assets/:id - Delete asset
  - PATCH /api/assets/:id/ownership - Update asset owner/administrator
- All endpoints require authentication (JWT token validation)
- SUPERVISOR and ADMIN roles required for accessing management functionality

### Security Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

- JWT token validation with proper role-based authorization
- SUPERVISOR and ADMIN roles required for accessing management functionality
- Input validation for all user and asset data to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting for management operations to prevent abuse
- Audit trail for all user and asset management operations
- Password hashing and security for user creation/updates
- Proper data sanitization for search queries

### Core Workflow Integration

User and asset management extends the supervisor dashboard workflow:

1. Supervisor logs in with appropriate permissions (SUPERVISOR/ADMIN role)
2. Accesses user management page to manage team members
3. Creates, updates, or deactivates user accounts with role assignments
4. Accesses asset management page to manage equipment inventory
5. Creates, updates, or deactivates assets with ownership assignments
6. Uses search and filtering to efficiently find specific users or assets
7. Performs batch operations for efficient data management

### Technical Constraints

- User management must preserve referential integrity with work orders and assignments
- Asset management must preserve relationships with work orders and maintenance history
- Soft deletion preferred over hard deletion to maintain data history
- User password updates must follow security best practices
- Asset code generation must ensure uniqueness for QR code compatibility
- Pagination must be efficient for large user and asset datasets
- Search functionality must be responsive and accurate
- Role changes must validate against business rules and permissions

### Project Structure Notes

File paths and component locations align with established project structure. The user and asset management functionality extends the existing user-service and asset-service microservices and requires new management pages in the web application for supervisors and administrators.

## Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]:**

- Follow test pyramid model: Unit tests > Integration tests > E2E tests [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]
