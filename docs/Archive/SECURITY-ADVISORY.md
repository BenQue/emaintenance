# ðŸ”’ SECURITY ADVISORY

## Critical Security Issue Fixed

**Date**: 2025-08-03  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: RESOLVED

### Issue Description

The `.env` file containing production database credentials and JWT secrets was accidentally committed to version control, creating a critical security vulnerability.

### Affected Files
- `.env` (removed from version control)
- Database credentials exposed
- JWT secret compromised

### Resolution Actions Taken

1. âœ… Removed `.env` from version control
2. âœ… Added comprehensive `.env*` patterns to `.gitignore`  
3. âœ… Created `.env.example` template with placeholder values
4. âœ… Updated documentation to reference secure environment setup

### Immediate Actions Required (Post-Deployment)

**CRITICAL - Must be completed before production deployment:**

1. **Rotate Database Credentials**:
   ```bash
   # Change database password immediately
   ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'new-secure-password';
   ```

2. **Generate New JWT Secret**:
   ```bash
   # Generate cryptographically secure JWT secret
   openssl rand -base64 64
   ```

3. **Update Environment Configuration**:
   - Use strong, unique secrets for production
   - Implement proper secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
   - Enable database connection encryption

4. **Security Audit**:
   - Review all existing JWT tokens (consider invalidating all sessions)
   - Monitor database access logs for suspicious activity
   - Implement additional monitoring and alerting

### Prevention Measures

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Implement git hooks to prevent sensitive file commits
2. **Secret Scanning**: Use tools like `git-secrets` or `detect-secrets`  
3. **Environment Validation**: Ensure production environments use proper secret management
4. **Team Training**: Educate team on secure development practices
