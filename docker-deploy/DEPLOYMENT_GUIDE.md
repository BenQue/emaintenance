- **Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors**: Resolved Select component type errors and other compilation issues
- **Corrected Tailwind CSS production build**: Fixed CSS optimization and tree-shaking for production
- **Secured environment configuration**: Removed hardcoded passwords and implemented secure password generation
- **Added comprehensive database seeding**: 50+ master data entries, 15+ sample assets, 15+ work orders
- **Improved Docker multi-stage builds**: Optimized image sizes and security
- **Enhanced monitoring and health checks**: Better service monitoring and automated recovery

## üö® Critical Security Notice

**NEVER commit `.env.production` files or any files containing actual passwords to version control!**

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04+ / CentOS 8+ / RHEL 8+
- **Memory**: Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: Minimum 50GB free space (100GB+ recommended for production)
- **CPU**: 4+ cores recommended
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for initial setup

### Software Requirements

- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+ or docker-compose 1.29+
- curl (for health checks)
- openssl (for password generation)

### Port Requirements

The following ports must be available:

- **3030**: Web application (HTTP)
- **3031**: User Service API
- **3032**: Work Order Service API  
- **3033**: Asset Service API
- **5433**: PostgreSQL database (internal access)
- **6379**: Redis cache (internal access)

## üîß Deployment Process

### Step 1: Prepare the Server

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker (Ubuntu/Debian)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Install Docker Compose (if not included)
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Create required directories
sudo mkdir -p /opt/emaintenance/{data,logs,backups}
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/emaintenance
```

### Step 2: Clone and Prepare the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository (or copy deployment files)
git clone <repository-url> /opt/emaintenance/source
cd /opt/emaintenance/source/docker-deploy

# OR copy deployment files to a clean directory
# Ensure you have: docker-compose.production.yml, scripts/, database/, nginx/, dockerfiles/
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment (CRITICAL SECURITY STEP)

```bash
# Generate secure environment configuration
./generate-passwords.sh

# Follow the prompts to:
# 1. Enter your server IP address
# 2. Review generated passwords
# 3. Securely store the credentials file
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: The script will create:

- `.env.production` with secure passwords
- `credentials-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt` with login details

**You MUST:**

1. Store the credentials file in a secure location (password manager)
2. Delete the credentials file from the server after storing it securely
3. NEVER commit `.env.production` to version control

### Step 4: Deploy the System

```bash
# Run the secure deployment script
./deploy-secure.sh

# The script will automatically:
# - Validate system requirements
# - Build optimized Docker images with multi-stage builds
# - Initialize PostgreSQL database with proper schemas
# - Run comprehensive database seeding (master data + sample data)
# - Start all services with health checks
# - Perform post-deployment validation
# - Display access URLs and credentials

# Expected deployment time: 5-10 minutes
# The script provides real-time progress updates and will stop on any errors
# - Create backups of existing data
# - Deploy all services with health checks  
# - Run database migrations and seeding
# - Verify all services are running
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

After deployment, verify all services:

```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:3031/health  # User service
curl http://localhost:3032/health  # Work order service  
curl http://localhost:3033/health  # Asset service
curl http://localhost:3030/health  # Web application via Nginx

# Check logs if needed
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs [service-name]
```
